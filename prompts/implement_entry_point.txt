Please help me implement the entry point as a command line interface of this AI bot.
1. Please use Python 3.11 or later.
2. Please use the library *pytest* for the test part.
3. Please also help me generate the unit test for each function of each object includes protected one or public one in this object.
4. Source code should be in the file *create_pr_bot/__main__.py*.
5. Test code should be in the file *test/unit_test/entry_point.py*.

The feature is as follows:
1. Add a new Python file named *__main__* as an entry point in the root folder of the project.
2. It should call function *CreatePrAIBot().run()* in entry point
3. It should have a data model about the settings. And the model has a utility function getting the setting values by
   environment variables and serialize as the data model.
4. Use the data model to set the options of instantiating the object *CreatePrAIBot*.
5. Use the data model to set the options of calling function *run* of the object *CreatePrAIBot*.
