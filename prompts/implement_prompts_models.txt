================ create =======================
Please help me implement the data models which only have one property named *content*. And the value is the content of
the prompt files at folder *create_pr_bot/ai_bot/prompts*. Different prompts should be different data models.
1. Please use Python 3.11 or later.
2. Please use the library *dataclass* for the data model implementation.
3. Please use the library *pytest* for the test part.
4. Have an utility function as factory pattern function to create data models about getting the file content from the file paths and serialize as data models.
5. Please also help me generate the unit test for each function in these data model objects.
6. Source code should be in the file *create_pr_bot/ai_bot/prompts/model.py*
7. Test code should be in the file *test/unit_test/ai_bot/prompts/model.py*
