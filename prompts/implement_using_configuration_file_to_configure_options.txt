================ create =======================
------------------ one prompt start ------------------
Please help me implement a feature about using a configuration file named *.github/pr-creator.yaml* to configure options.
1. Current development runtime environment using *Poetry* to manage the project. So please use Poetry way to run relative commands.
2. Please use Python 3.11 or later.
3. You have the existing software architecture of this feature at Python module *create_pr_bot/model.py*. Please adjust
   the existing implementations for this feature.
4. Please use the library *pytest* for the test part.
5. Please also help me generate the unit test for each function of each object includes protected one or public one in this object.

The code change points are as follows:
1. A utility function about loading the configration file from the specific file path. And the specific file path would be a command line argument.
2. Use the existing software architecture to modify. Please implement a utility function about serializing data from the dict type value of configuration as a data model.

================ improvement (or refactoring) =======================
------------------ one prompt start ------------------
Please rename the utility functions about serializing data from the dict type value to a data model in module
*create_pr_bot/model.py* as *serialize*, doesn't name it as *from_dict*.
And please also adjust the unit test naming in test module **test/unit_test/model.py** to align the functions naming.
