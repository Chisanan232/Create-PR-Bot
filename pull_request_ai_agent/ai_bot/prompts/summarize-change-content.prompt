I would open a pull request (aka PR) for the current change for remote GitHub repository. And I need a description about
the target (why do this?), change details (how do this?), etc. for the PR to let reviewer could clearly understand what
you do and why you do. So I need you read the following contents and help me organize and summarize all of them for the
PR description.
1. Here are the task tickets about title or detail from project management tool like ClickUp, Jira, etc.
    ```json
    {{ task_tickets_details }}
    ```
2. Here are all the git commit messages about the code changes.
    ```shell
    {{ all_commits }}
    ```

And please summarize the content as the result with the following format as this project pull request template:
    ```markdown
    {{ pull_request_template }}
    ```

It already has description of each sections in the template setting. Please fill up the mapping values for each section.
