I would open a pull request (aka PR) for the current change for remote GitHub repository. And I need a summary as the PR
title about the target (why do this?) or change brief (how do this?) for the PR to let reviewer could quickly and clearly
understand what you do and why you do. So I need you read the following contents and help me organize all of them and
summarize them as ONLY ONE sentence finally for the PR title. And if it's possible, please keep the PR title short and
concise, the standard is less than 15 words.
1. Here are the task tickets about title or detail from project management tool like ClickUp, Jira, etc.
    ```json
    {{ task_tickets_details }}
    ```
2. Here are all the git commit messages about the code changes.
    ```shell
    {{ all_commits }}
    ```
