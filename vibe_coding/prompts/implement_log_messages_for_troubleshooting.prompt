This is a GitHub PR AI agent project which uses Python with Poetry. I want to add more log messages for being helpful in troubleshooting. Please help me add log messages at the necessary points and remember help me classify the log message as the appropiate log level.
Remember, the log messages for being helpful in troubleshooting, so it doesn’t need to add too many log messages at the trivial logic. And please:
1. Please use Python 3.12 or later.
2. Please use the library *pytest* for the test part.

Please help me add the log messages in my source code.

This is a Python project uses Poetry to mange project settings. I do some code change to fix the incorrect logic in
source code. But it cause the tests be broken. Could you help me fix the broke tests without any breaking change in
source code?
And the test framework the project uses is Poetry. For run all tests, please use command line `poetry run bash
./scripts/run_all_tests.sh 'all-test’`.

This is a Python project uses Poetry to mange project settings. About the implementation for the test specially. I think
bind the logic which only for test in source code is not a good idea and not a great design to implement. Is it possible
that extract the test logic out to test code like using mock way to mock the specific functions or properties for test?
If it has, could you help me adjust the code to fix it?
