================ create =======================
Please help me implement a module about doing some operations with git.
About how to implement:
1. Please use Python 3.10 or later.
2. Please use the library *gitpython*.
3. Please use the library *pytest* for the test part.
4. Wrap the code in an object.
5. Each feature be a method of this object.
6. Some of them would be protected methods. Please check the comment at last.
7. Please also help me generate the unit test for each function includes protected one or public one in this object.
8. Source code should be in the file *create_pr_bot/git_hdlr.py*
9. Test code should be in the file *test/unit_test/git_hdlr.py*

About feature implements what I want:
1. Get the current git branch. (protected method)
2. Get the head commit details of the specific git branch name. (public method)
3. Get remote head commit details of the base git branch. (public method)
4. Check the local head commit of the specific git branch is out of date or not. Use the remote head commit of the base git branch to compare. And I think we can reuse the functions of 2 and 3. (public method)
5. Fetch and merge the remote git branch to the local specific git branch. (public method)
    5-1. Please remember that if it has a code conflict when merging code, please raise a customized exception named *GitCodeConflictError* and stop the process.
6. Push the local specific git branch to the remote git repo. (public method)

================ change =======================
About the test part, please change to use PyTest to implement the unit test.

================ fix code =======================
It has broken tests. Followings are the failed tests and its error messages in brief:

Do you have any ideas to understand and fix it? And please also tell me why.
